* File name should be exactly same as for templates as well as properties file.
* Customized folder name should be defined like <CabinetName(lowercase)>_<ProcessDefID>.
* Macros that are defined in existing templates and properties files, can only be used while creating customized templates and properties files.

For example, take file 'DeclineTask_en_US.htm', for Task Name you can use macro &<TaskName>& . So this macro will be valid for customized declined template as well as properties file required to configure subject text.
