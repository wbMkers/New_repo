Cabinet Upgrade - Points to Remember/ Pre-requisites
----------------------------------------------------
1. EJBs corresponding to OmniFlow version 7.x or later should be deployed on the Application Server.

2. CS installed from setups of OmniFlow version 7.x or later.

3. SQL files containing upgrade information stored in a directory.

4. The Working directory of Application Servers contain a folder ngdbini.
   Absolute path of the Directory mentioned in the previous step to be mentioned in WFAppContext.xml present in ngdbini,
	<CabUpgradePath>ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_UPGRADE_FILES</CabUpgradePath>.

5. SQL files must be tilde [~] separated. 

6. All upgrade files must have a ".sql" extension.

7. Instead of sending One lengthy upgrade file, following convention could be followed,
	a. One Upgrade file could contain all the create/ alter tables, indexes, sequences etc.
	b. Another Upgrade file could contain all views.
	c. In case of Stored Procedures, One Upgrade file should contain One Procedure.

8. Naming of Files is very important.
   a. All filenames should be in same case i.e. either all are in Uppercase or all are in Lowercase.
   b. All filenames should follow same naming convention.
   c. Present Upgrade Code executes the filenames in Ascending Order.
   d. All tables, view creation/ alteration scripts should be the ones to be executed first.
	
   For Example >>
   a. If 10 files have been prepared for upgrade then names could be, 
      upgrade01.sql	[This will be executed first]
      upgrade02.sql	[This will be executed second]
      .
      .
      .
      upgrade10.sql,	[This will be executed last]
      similarly,

   b. If 100 files have been prepared for upgrade then names could be, 
      upgrade001.sql	[This will be executed first]
      upgrade002.sql	[This will be executed second]
      .
      .
      .
      .
      upgrade100.sql.	[This will be executed last]

   etc.

9. On completion of upgradation, WFCabVersionTable can be referred to cross check which ones succeeded and which ones failed.
